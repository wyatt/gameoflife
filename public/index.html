				<h1>Conway's Game of Life</h1>
				<p>
					This was made for a small project in order to learn the basics of
					<a href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser</a>. It displays an example of a
					zero player game, known as the Game of Life, devised by John Conway in
					1970. It is called a 'cellular automata' and it simulates population
					growth and decline. There are many initial patterns that determine the
					result of the game, each with their own unique properties. This
					particular pattern is known as the Gosper glider gun and is the first
					infinitely growing start pattern discovered.
