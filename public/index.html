			<h1>Conway's Game of Life</h1>
			<p>
				This was made for a small project in order to learn the basics of
				Phaser. It displays an example of a zero player game, known as the Game
				of Life, devises by John Conway in 1970. It is called a 'cellular
				automata' and it simulates population shifts. There are many initial
				patterns that determine the result of the game -This particular pattern
				is shown as Gospher glider gun and is the first pattern discovered that
				can grow infinitely.
