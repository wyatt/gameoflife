# Conway's Game of Life

This was made for a small project in order to learn the basics of Phaser. It displays an example of a zero player game, known as the Game of Life, devises by John Conway in 1970. It is called a 'cellular automata' and it simulates population shifts. There are many initial patterns that determine the result of the game -This particular pattern is shown as Gospher glider gun and is the first pattern discovered that can grow infinitely.
