# ðŸŒ± Conway's Game of Life

This was made for a small project in order to learn the basics of Phaser. It displays an example of a zero player game, known as the Game of Life, devised by John Conway in 1970. It is called a 'cellular automata' and it simulates population growth and decline. There are many initial patterns that determine the result of the game, each with their own unique properties. This particular pattern is known as the Gosper glider gun and is the first infinitely growing start pattern discovered. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

### Tools used
- ðŸŽ® Phaser 3: Efficient and easy-to-use JS game engine
- âŒ¨ Typescript: Supercharges my code with types and really really good linting.
- ðŸ—» Snowpack: Webpack, but faster and shinier

### Run yourself
1. Install dependencies with `yarn`
2. Build with `yarn build` and then deploy the `_build` folder. You can also just simply run the project with the command `yarn start`

### Acknowledgements
Templated from [phaser3-ts-snowpack-eslint](https://github.com/pawap90/phaser3-ts-snowpack-eslint). Super easy to get started with, but the ESLint config is too strict for my taste.
