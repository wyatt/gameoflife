# Conway's Game of Life

This was made for a small project in order to learn the basics of
				Phaser. It displays an example of a zero player game, known as the Game
				of Life, devised by John Conway in 1970. It is called a 'cellular
				automata' and it simulates population growth and decline. There are many
				initial patterns that determine the result of the game, each with their
				own unique properties. This particular pattern is known as the Gosper
				glider gun and is the first infinitely growing start pattern discovered.
